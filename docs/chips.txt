There are several different embedded controller chips that have been
used over the thinkpad range.  This file lists the ones that we have
seen and is a place for recording information about them.

It is not intended to be an exhaustive list, as that would require
schematics, physical inspection or reverse engineering the EC firmware
for a lot of different models.

ThinkPad T4x/p and R5x/p:
-------------------------
    Renesas H8S/2161BV
    (source: http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?t=20958)

ThinkPad x220:
--------------
    Renesas H8S R4F2113NFT-1-GP
    Looks very similar to the 2161BV

    (source: physical inspection, reverse engineering the EC firmware
    and the schematics - http://plan9.stanleylieber.com/hardware/thinkpad/x220/x220.schematics.pdf)

ThinkPad xx30 series:
---------------------
    SMSC/Microchip MEC1619L-AJZP-GP

    This is a 32-bit ARC core CPU, with most of the firmware written using
    the ARCompact variant of the instruction set

    MEC product family specs:

    Microchip product page:

        (note that microchip does not have a real datasheet available)

Thinkpad x250:
--------------
    An ARCompact instruction set CPU, so probably a MEC1619

    (source: reverse engineering the EC firmware)

Thinkpad x260:
--------------
    An ARCompact instruction set CPU, so probably a MEC1619

    (source: reverse engineering the EC firmware)
