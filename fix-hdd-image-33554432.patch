Qemu does not support disk images with more than 16 heads, but the lenovo
disk image is created with 64 heads.  Since the MBR they used does not use
LBA to access the disk, this confuses it and causes it to fail.

This patch changes the partition end head/cylinder, which is all that is
needed to make the MBR happy

This patch is for disk images with 65536 sectors (33554432 bytes)
