The main purpose of this software is to patch the EC on xx30 series thinkpads
to make the classic 7-row keyboards work.

With the patches included here, you can install the classic keyboard
hardware on many xx30 series laptops and make almost every key work properly.
The only keys that are not working are Fn+F3 (Battery) and Fn+F12 (Hibernate)

Step-by-step instructions:
--------------------------

This software expects to be run under Linux.

1. Ensure you have the normal packages needed for development work.
   On debian, this can be done with:

    apt-get install build-essential git

2. Ensure that a couple of tools and libraries needed by this system are
   also installed:

    apt-get install mtools libssl-dev

3. Clone a copy of this repo on to your computer:

    git clone https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec

4. Change to the directory created by the clone:

    cd thinkpad-ec

5. Show the list of laptops and USB image file names:

    make list_laptops

6. Select the correct IMG name for your laptop.  E.G. "patched.x230.img" for
   the x230 laptop.

7. Make the fully patched iimage for this laptop (this will download
   the original file from Lenovo and patch it):

    make patched.x230.img

8. Insert your USB stick and determine what device name it has.
   This command should help you find the right device:

    lsblk -d -p -o NAME,SIZE,LABEL

9. Write the bootable patched image onto the USB stick device

   WARNING: if you do not have the right device name, you might overwrite
   your hard drive!

   sudo dd if=patched.x230.img of=/dev/sdb

Your USB stick is now ready to boot and install the patched firmware.

When you boot this, you will be prompted with information about the patch
and asked to confirm your laptop type.  It will then automatically flash
the patched firmware.


Notes:

* You can also create a bootable CDROM image for burning to a disk
  by asking for a ".iso" file in step 7 above.  Then you can use your
  normal CDROM burning tools to put this image on a blank cd and boot
  it up, skipping steps 8 and 9.

* More information for hacking on this can be found in the docs/HACKING.txt
  file.
