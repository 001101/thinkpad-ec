This repository consists of a number of tools and utilities for examining and
modifying Thinkpad Embedded Controller firmware.

Including:
*   radare projects with partial disassembly of several thinkpads
*   scripts for downloading the ISO image and extracting the firmware
*   script for patching the firmware
*   documentation on the tables found in the firmware (TODO)

Quick Start:

    To fetch the firmware from Lenovo, extract, decrypt and patch
    it, ready for more patching, choose one of:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img
        make t430s.G7HT39WW.img

    To update the checksums and encrypt the patched firmware, ready to
    be inserted into the FL2 file, choose one of:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img.enc
        make t430s.G7HT39WW.img.enc

    To re-insert the EC firmware into the bios flash file, use a command
    similar to the following:

        dd if=x230.G2HT35WW.img.enc of=\$01D3000.FL2 conv=notrunc bs=4096 seek=1280

    To update your firmware, prepare a DOS boot disk with the FL2 file and
    the dosflash.exe utility and then use a command similar to:

        dosflash /sd /ipf ec /file $01D3000.FL2
