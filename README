The main purpose of this software is to patch the EC on xx30 series thinkpads
to make the classic 7-row keyboards work.

With the patches included here, you can install the classic keyboard
hardware on many xx30 series laptops and make almost every key work properly.
The only keys that are not working are Fn+F3 (Battery) and Fn+F12 (Hibernate)

Step-by-step instructions:
--------------------------

This software expects to be run under Linux.

1. Ensure you have the normal packages needed for development work.
   On debian, this can be done with:

    apt-get install build-essential git

2. Ensure you have the "mtools" package installed:

    apt-get install mtools

3. Clone a copy of this repo on to your computer:

    git clone https://github.com/hamishcoleman/thinkpad-ec

4. Change to the directory created by the clone:

    cd thinkpad-ec

5. Show the list of laptops and ISO image names:

    make list_laptops

   (note that this list might change from time to time if there are new
   BIOS versions released)

6. Select the correct ISO name for your laptop.  E.G. "patched.x230.iso" for
   the x230 laptop.

7. Create the patched ISO for this laptop (this will download the original
   file from Lenovo and patch it):

    make patched.x230.iso

8. Use your normal CDROM burning tools to put this image on a blank cd and
   boot it up.  You will be prompted with information about the patch and
   asked to confirm your laptop type.  Then it will automatically flash
   the patched firmware.


Notes:

* These thinkpads will boot from a USB cdrom drive, so you do not need one
  internal to your laptop for this to work.

* If you do not have a cdrom, or do not want to use it, it is possible to
  extract an image from the ISO that is suitable for placing on a bootable
  USB stick (I hope to add this as an automated feature shortly)

* More information for hacking on this can be found in the docs/HACKING.txt
  file.
