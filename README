The main purpose of this software is to patch the EC on xx30 series thinkpads
to make the classic 7-row keyboards work.

With the patches included here, you can install the classic keyboard
hardware on many xx30 series laptops and make almost every key work properly.
The only keys that are not working are Fn+F3 (Battery) and Fn+F12 (Hibernate)

A full writeup of the hardware modifications needed can be found at:
    http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Install_Classic_Keyboard_on_xx30_Series_ThinkPads

Quick Start:
------------

    There are separate make target commands for each different laptop,
    this command will produce a list of them:

        make list_iso

    To fetch the ISO image, patch it and create a new bootable ISO image:

        make g2uj23us.iso
        # This example will produce a patched x230 image

Other uses:
-----------

This repository also contains number of tools and utilities for examining
and modifying Thinkpad Embedded Controller firmware.

Including:
*   radare projects with partial disassembly of several thinkpads EC firmware
*   scripts for downloading the ISO image and extracting the firmware
*   script for patching the firmware
*   documentation on the tables found in the firmware (TODO)

Slightly slower Start:
----------------------

If you expect to do development work, the following two make targets
are probably useful:

    To list the available raw image files and FL2 files:

        make list_iso

    To fetch the firmware from Lenovo, extract, decrypt and patch
    it, ready for more patching:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img

    To create a new FL2, ready for flashing:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.s01D3000.FL2

    To update your firmware, copy the FL2 file generated above and
    the dosflash.exe utility to a DOS boot disk and then use a command
    similar to:

        dosflash /sd /ipf ec /file s01D3000.FL2
