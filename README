This repository consists of a number of tools and utilities for examining and
modifying Thinkpad Embedded Controller firmware.

Including:
*   radare projects with partial disassembly of several thinkpads EC firmware
*   scripts for downloading the ISO image and extracting the firmware
*   script for patching the firmware
*   documentation on the tables found in the firmware (TODO)

Quick Start:

    There are similar make target commands for:
        x230
        t430
        t430s


    To fetch the firmware from Lenovo, extract, decrypt and patch
    it, ready for more patching:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.img

    To create a new FL2, ready for flashing:

        make x230.G2HT35WW.s01D3000.FL2

    To update your firmware, copy the FL2 file generated above and
    the dosflash.exe utility to a DOS boot disk and then use a command
    similar to:

        dosflash /sd /ipf ec /file s01D3000.FL2
